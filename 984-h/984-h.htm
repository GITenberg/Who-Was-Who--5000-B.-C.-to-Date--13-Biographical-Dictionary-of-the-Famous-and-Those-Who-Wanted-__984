    <p>
      THE editor begs leave to inform the public that only persons who can
      produce proper evidence of their demise will be admitted to Who Was Who.

      from the ex-celebrities or their enemies. These will be accepted gratis.
      Proofs will be sent to all subscribers. Members of the family will be able
      to order the coming editions in advance by applying and remitting to the
      publisher.

      once. Born shortly after Adam, and is still up to mischievous tricks. It
      was he who made kings fall in love with poor country girls; chauffeurs
      with their ladies, and beggars with princesses. C. held all men and women
      equal provided they were good, and he made the happiest people on earth
      when they listened to his voice. He witnessed several international
      engagements, but did not like them, as the contestants gave him a black
      eye. He also was responsible for mothers-in-law. Some roads he made very
      rough, but C. always was a good guide. At times he caused pain, but he
      said it never was his fault. When C. stayed in a house the sun was always
      shining. You should be at home when he calls. Ambition: That sigh.
      Recreation: Archery. Address: Perhaps you know. Clubs: None. He prefers
      the fireside and moonlight nights.

      and the leader of the Ghetto. When M. waxed astute, after the manner of
      his people, he discovered there were not sufficient shekels for himself
      and countrymen in the land of Egypt. He pleaded and plagued the king for
      permission to close the pawn shops and clothing stores. Now in those days
      the children of Egypt were wont to patronize the bazaars of the children
      of the Chosen, and Pharaoh was wroth within himself and refused the
      passports. The brave rabbi closed the kosher meat stores and took ship's
      leave. Adopting an original compass, he made forced marches to the Red
      Sea. Here the synagogue was overtaken by Pharaoh and his army. M. spilled
      the sea on them and marched on. From this time the journey to the Promised
      Land was slow. Whether this was due to good business or sore feet history
      does not relate. M. later climbed a mountain and received the ten
      commandments. After breaking them he returned to camp. He died before the
      journey was complete. Publications: Histories. Ambition: A railroad from

      NAPOLEON, a little Frenchman who wore a big hat, a little curl on his
      forehead, and whose ambitions were larger than his good luck. Started life
      by placing Corsica on the map. Like all great men, he was the dunce at
      school. Later he used his masters and prize-winning chums as first-row
      soldiers. Entered the army. Never succeeded as a sentry. Frequently amused
      himself by taking a couple of soldiers and capturing a city or an army
      between meals. The politicians in Paris saw the young man was not without
      talents. They gave him a few more soldiers. Then he went after countries.
      Captured Egypt, but had trouble with one Nelson of England. N. became
      unpopular with his neighbors. They all attacked him. He attacked them all.
      That settled it. He ate wars. After the powers were powerless N. scampered
      about Europe adding countries to France. He devoured Germany. Went after
      Russia, but they made it too hot and too cold for him. Had more trouble
      with that man Nelson. Became rich and divorced. Introduced Roosevelt
      publicity tactics into France and carried a third term. Started things.
      Began quarreling again. At last he was cooped up in Paris, and flew the
      white flag. Visited Elba. Revisited France. Started things again. Took
      some veterans to Belgium. There he was met by another Englishman by the
      name of Wellington who introduced him to Waterloo. For his kindness in
      leaving Europe England presented N. with a whole island, a complementary
      guard, and paid all his living expenses for six years. Later N. became
      responsible for one of the sights of Paris. Always carried his right hand
      in the front of his coat. Ambition: A French Nelson, England, and progeny.

      band-wagon driver, band-wagon, Panama canal, rough rider, circus leader,
      circus, down-with-rafter, and a former retired and retiring president of
      the United States. When a young man he spent his father's money by going
      to college, shooting lions, and raising a large family. During the
      Spanish-American War he employed a troop of rough riders, stormed San Juan
      Hill, and got into the newspapers. Made up his mind he would stay there.
      R. became governor of New York State with ambitions. Being a wealthy man,
      and capable of contributing to the cause of the Republican party, he was
      elected vice-president of the United States. A hand other than his own
      made him president. Here his newspaper career really began. R. first
      opened a three-ring circus in the White House, wore a rough rider hat, and
      told the country what a great president he was. The voters believed him,
      and did not object to four years more. During this administration R.
      successfully advertised himself, the family, started the Panama Canal, and
      appointed one William Howard Taft (see Poor Bill) his successor. R. then
      traveled through Africa with a magnificent body guard of photographers and
      newspaper men. After shooting a museum-full of specimens, he toured Europe
      and told the king how to king and the emperors how to emp. Returning to
      the United States he placed his hand in state politics. Fingers were badly
      burned. When it came time to elect another president, R. was tired of

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
